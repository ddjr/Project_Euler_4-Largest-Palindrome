# Project_Euler_4-Largest-Palindrome

This Project was done as part of https://projecteuler.net/ problem sets. This code solves problem 4. The following discription is taken from https://projecteuler.net/problem=4:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

To run the project open your terminal, find the directory where this file is located, and type python largest_palindrome.py
